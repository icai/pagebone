# Pagebone
thinking in Backbone.


## About Pagebone

Over the past few years, I'm dealing with Backbone.js. As the name `Backbone`, He's just a backbone, but not the all for your framework and architecture. I think that Backbone is weak in Router and View module. So I write Pagebone  will redesign these.   
   
Pagebone is ES6 architecture, webpack and browserify to build.




## Features

Pagebone will kill the Backbone framework like marionette.js, BackboneLayoutManager etc.

And I try to keep all the backbone api instances.



### View

### Router


Provide a  router middleware like expressjs (complete),    
Controller like laravel framework(no do)   
Route map for multi pages application   


note: Router middleware now just rewrite the 'route' method.   



### MiddleWare(new)


Provide a middleWare to global use, as View Module.(complete)
